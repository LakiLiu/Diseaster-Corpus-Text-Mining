# Diseaster-Corpus-Text-Mining

On the social media, there are many people talking about diseasters. However, some of them are only talking the disasters in the film, or even just for a joke. This makes it difficult to distinguish people's sentiments to the real diseaster.

Hence, this project is to predict if the corpus is real about disaster topic. The text mining is mainly analysed by Natural Language Processing nltk library.
